The primary drivers for us and many others are the rising housing costs, increased cost of living, rising crime, job opportunities, and political unrest. The purpose of this Data Science project is to provide a framework for exploring neighborhoods in Texas to determine which areas to consider moving to and will explore factors including crime rates, unemployment rates, percent near libraries/parks, and availability of grocery stores, restaurants, and other amenities. I will specifically be exploring neighborhoods in Fort Worth as this is where we are considering moving but the code will be applicable to other cities/neighborhoods and will only need to be updated with specific datasets for whatever area is being considered."
